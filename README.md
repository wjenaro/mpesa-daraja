# Journey to Learn and Document the Daraja API

Welcome! This journey demonstrates how to integrate with Safaricom's M-Pesa Daraja API using Node.js and Express, focusing on the OAuth authentication flow necessary to obtain access tokens for API operations.

> **Please note:**  
> I will keep updating this documentation as we goâ€”stay tuned for improvements and additional insights!

Thank you for being part of this learning process.

## Overview

This Node.js application exposes a single endpoint to help you understand and interact with the M-Pesa Daraja API's OAuth service. The goal is to simplify learning the authentication process, including environment setup, code organization, and error handling.

## Architecture

*Coming soon... (This section will cover the high-level components and flow of the application, including how requests are handled and how authentication is managed.)*
