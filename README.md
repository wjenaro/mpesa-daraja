# Journey to Learn and Document the Daraja API
# Journey to Learn and Document the Daraja API

Welcome! This journey demonstrates how to integrate with Safaricom's M-Pesa Daraja API using Node.js and Express, with a focus on the **OAuth authentication flow** necessary to obtain access tokens for API operations.

*Please note: I will keep updating this documentation as we goâ€”stay tuned for improvements and additional insights!*

Thank you for being part of this learning process.
